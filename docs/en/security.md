# Web UI Security Model

> [中文](../zh-CN/security.md) | English

This document describes the security defenses of `illusion-forge`: what is enforced, what the rules are, and how to configure them.

***

## 1. Overview

Every `/api/*` and `/ws` request passes through two layers:

1. **Web access authentication** (implementation: `src/illusion/ui/web/auth.py`) verifies *who* is accessing: signed cookie / `Authorization: Bearer` / `?token=` — any valid credential lets the request through, otherwise 401.
2. **Browser-trust fence** (implementation: `src/illusion/ui/web/security.py`) verifies *where* the request comes from: Host check + Sec-Fetch-Site check + Origin same-origin check, rejecting on the first failure (403).

Both layers are always on (fail-closed) with no bypass switch; normal local use is fully transparent — open the full URL printed at startup once and you are signed in.

## 2. The Three Fences

| Fence                        | Rule                                                                                                         | Defends Against           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Host check**               | Host header must be a loopback address or an explicitly declared trusted host                                | DNS rebinding             |
| **Sec-Fetch-Site check**     | `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` → reject                                                                        | Modern cross-site fetches |
| **Origin same-origin check** | If Origin is present it must match Host exactly; literal `null` → reject; absent → covered by the Host fence | CSWSH / CSRF              |

Decision flow:

```
request → ① Host is loopback or trusted? ──no──→ 403
            │yes
            ↓
          ② Sec-Fetch-Site == cross-site? ──yes──→ 403
            │no
            ↓
          ③ no Origin header → allow (fence ① already bound the request)
             Origin present → same origin as Host? ──no──→ 403
            │yes
            ↓
           allow
```

Rule details:

* **The Host fence binds every request.** Over plain HTTP, browser image loads and navigations carry neither Origin nor Sec-Fetch headers — indistinguishable from curl — so there is no "missing marker" shortcut anywhere.

* **Ports are irrelevant to the defense.** The fence inspects only the hostname part of the Host header — `127.0.0.1:3000`, `127.0.0.1:8080`, and `127.0.0.1:58896` are all allowed, while `evil.example` is rejected on every port. If the service moves to another port, protection is unchanged; "default 3000" is just a default argument value.

* **WebSocket handshakes are checked before accept**; a rejected handshake gets an HTTP 403 upgrade refusal and never enters session state.

* Rejections are uniform: `403 Forbidden` with plain-text body `forbidden`.

## 3. Plane Separation

The two entry points carry different privilege levels:

| Endpoint      | Payload                                                                 | Trusted hosts allowed? |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `REST /api/*` | Privileged plane: environment config & credentials, cron jobs, channels | **No — loopback only** |
| `WS /ws`      | Session plane: conversation, agent driving                              | Yes                    |

In other words, a LAN device declared as a trusted host can use chat, but every configuration / credential / task-management operation stays local-only. The corresponding frontend panels degrade gracefully with errors when accessed from another machine.

Additionally, FastAPI's auto-generated API docs (`/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`) are disabled entirely — they sit outside the fenced paths yet expose the full API schema.

Static assets (pages and scripts) are unfenced: they contain nothing sensitive, so any attack chain terminates at the API fence.

## 4. Trusted Host Configuration

### 4.1 Declaring Them

```bash
# Explicit declaration (repeatable)
illusion-forge --trusted-host nas.example
illusion-forge --trusted-host nas.example:8080   # exact port
illusion-forge --trusted-host [fd00::5]          # IPv6 literal

# Binding all interfaces auto-derives this machine's LAN addresses
illusion-forge --host 0.0.0.0
```

When binding to `0.0.0.0` or `::`, startup samples this machine's LAN-reachable unicast addresses (excluding loopback / link-local / multicast) and merges them into the trusted list. Virtual adapter addresses may be included as well; pass `--trusted-host` explicitly when you need finer control.

### 4.2 Canonical Form Requirement

Entries must be bare canonical `host[:port]`. Malformed variants abort startup with a loud error instead of being silently ignored:

| Variant                                    | Rejected Because                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x7f.0.0.1` / `127.1` / `127.000.000.001` | Browsers normalize variant IPs before filling the Host header; such entries never match real traffic |
| `example.1` / `0x7f000001`                 | WHATWG parses the whole host as IPv4 when the last label is numeric/hex                              |
| `user@nas.example`                         | userinfo injection                                                                                   |
| `nas.example/path`                         | embedded path                                                                                        |
| `nas.example:081`                          | zero-padded port                                                                                     |
| `" nas.example"`                           | surrounding whitespace                                                                               |

Ordinary hostnames containing digits (`nas1.example.com`, `pi4.lan`) are unaffected.

### 4.3 Matching Rules

* An entry without a port matches the hostname on **any port**;

* An entry with a port requires host and port to match exactly.

***

## 5. Web Access Authentication

The authentication layer gates *who may use this web UI* :

* **Launch token**: generated randomly on every startup (valid for the process lifetime). The CLI prints the full access URL with the token (`http://host:port/?token=...`). Non-browser clients (scripts, tests) can authenticate with an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or a `?token=` query parameter.

* **Signed cookie**: on the first visit carrying the token, the server mints an HMAC-SHA256 signed cookie (HttpOnly + SameSite=Strict + authority binding + 30-day lifetime) and 303-redirects to a clean URL without the token — the address bar keeps no token, subsequent requests authenticate via the cookie. The cookie name is fixed and each token exchange overwrites it (authority binding lives in the signed payload), so dynamic ports (the desktop app picks a random port on every launch) or concurrent instances never accumulate cookies in the browser jar; the desktop app additionally clears session cookies once at startup (after acquiring the single-instance lock), keeping the jar empty at boot.

* **Persistent signing secret**: the cookie signing key is persisted in the config directory (`~/.illusion/web_auth_secret.json`, a 32-byte random). Cookies survive backend restarts, so you don't have to reopen the printed URL.

The three credential paths are equivalent and optional: signed cookie (browser), `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (REST/WS), `?token=` query parameter (WS/static probes). Token comparison is constant-time; tampered, expired, or cross-authority cookies are rejected.

***

## 6. Design Boundary

* The fence filters request origins (DNS rebinding / CSRF); the authentication layer verifies access credentials — distinct duties, neither is optional.

* Authentication is access control for local / trusted-host deployments, **not a multi-user identity system**: all credentials share the same launch token with no per-user isolation. For multi-user isolation, put TLS + auth in a reverse proxy in front of the service — do not loosen the fence.

## 7. Behavior Cheat Sheet

| Scenario                                                                           | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Local browser opens the full URL printed by the CLI (with token)                   | First visit exchanges the token for a signed cookie and redirects to a clean URL; normal use                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Local browser opens a bare address (no token)                                      | REST / WS / index all return 401 (prompt to use the full URL)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 8. Tests

* Full regression coverage of the authentication layer lives in `tests/web/test_web_auth.py` (token validation, signed-cookie minting/tampering/expiry/authority binding, the three credential paths, WS handshake, 401 before 403).

* Regression coverage of the fence lives in `tests/web/test_browser_trust.py`.
