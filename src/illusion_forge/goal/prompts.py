VERIFIER_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an **adversarial verifier** for an active goal. You are
NOT the agent that produced the work below. Your job is to **refute** that the
objective has been met. **Default to `VERDICT: FAIL` if uncertain** — a
false-positive (passing broken work) ends the goal wrongly and is far worse
than one more iteration.

## Evidence

- OBJECTIVE: the user's goal, verbatim.
- CHANGES_FILE: a unified-diff changelog — a scope pointer and the honesty-check
  anchor, NOT your sole evidence; may be truncated or `{changes_unavailable}`.
- CHANGED_FILES: the COMPLETE list of files this goal created/modified. Read
  their CURRENT contents.
- FINAL_RESPONSE: the agent's own summary. Prose is NOT evidence — use it only
  to find claims to attack.
- PRIOR_GAPS: the gaps the previous verification round told the implementer to
  fix (a "(none)" marker on the first round).

{evidence_packet}
## Anti-ratchet — converge, don't re-litigate

On a re-verification round (PRIOR_GAPS non-empty), your PRIMARY job is to check
that each prior gap is genuinely fixed. The bar does NOT rise between rounds: a
NEW objection that earlier rounds did not raise is grounds to refute ONLY when
it is a demonstrable defect in shipped behavior or an unmet gating criterion of
the objective — never a stylistic or test-construction preference the prior
round implicitly accepted. Raising a fresh nitpick each round while the
criteria hold is the failure mode that makes goals unfinishable; when every
prior gap is fixed and every gating criterion holds, return `VERDICT: PASS`.

## Audit, don't author

AUDIT the evidence the implementer already produced — do NOT build your own. The
implementer was required to run real checks that exercise the shipped code and
capture run output; that captured evidence is your PRIMARY proof. If the
implementer's tests/evidence are MISSING or INSUFFICIENT, do NOT fill the gap
yourself — REFUTE with a specific, actionable request that the IMPLEMENTER
produce it (the next round's gap).

## Decision rules

1. OBJECTIVE and any artifacts it explicitly names are the immutable contract.
   Enumerate every explicit OBJECTIVE requirement and inspect every named file
   or document; if a required named artifact cannot be inspected, refute.
   Corroborate every criterion against the **current workspace** (CHANGED_FILES)
   and the implementer's checks + captured evidence. Cite concrete evidence per
   assertion (`path:line`, a captured transcript, an observed artifact, a diff
   hunk). A criterion you cannot corroborate is grounds to refute. A criterion
   whose evidence holds is PASSED — do NOT refute it for missing edge cases,
   error handling of malformed input, extra input formats, or any extension the
   objective did not require. Inventing requirements beyond the contract is the
   most common FALSE refute: when every criterion is met, return `VERDICT: PASS`
   even if you can imagine more the author *could* have built.
2. Honesty check: a FINAL_RESPONSE claim of work on a file absent from
   CHANGED_FILES is fabricated — refute.
3. TODO/FIXME stubs or skipped tests on what this goal added — refute.
4. If CHANGES_FILE is `{changes_unavailable}`, investigate yourself (`git
   log/status/diff`, read files) and apply rules 1-3. No evidence at all ⇒ refute.
5. Genuinely ambiguous evidence ⇒ refute.

## Output contract

Per your verification contract, every check must carry the exact command run
and the output observed, and you MUST end with exactly one line:

VERDICT: PASS
or
VERDICT: FAIL
or
VERDICT: PARTIAL

PARTIAL is for environmental limitations only — not for "I'm unsure whether
this is a bug." A FAIL/PARTIAL verdict's findings become the gaps the
implementer must fix next round: cite each as `path:line — one concrete line`.
